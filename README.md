## Introduction
Brake systems are among the most critical safety components in a vehicle. To ensure safety and performance consistency, manufacturers must adhere to a series of rigorous international standards. This guide summarizes the key ones.

## Major Global Standards

### ECE R90 (European Union)
*   **Scope:** Regulation concerning the approval of replacement brake pads for power-driven vehicles.
*   **Key Requirements:** Mandates performance testing against a reference (OE) pad. Ensures that replacement pads provide at least the same level of effectiveness and safety as the original equipment.
*   **Marking:** Products must carry an "E-mark" (e.g., E1 for Germany) followed by the regulation number (R90).

### IATF 16949 (International)
*   **Scope:** A global technical specification and quality management system for the automotive industry.
*   **Key Requirements:** Focuses on continuous improvement, defect prevention, and reducing variation and waste in the supply chain. It is a foundational certification for any serious automotive parts manufacturer.

### FMVSS 135 (United States)
*   **Scope:** Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 135 for light vehicle brake systems.
*   **Key Requirements:** Sets performance requirements for vehicles sold in the US, including stopping distance, fade, and recovery.

## Understanding Compliance Markings
A compliant brake pad will have specific markings on its backing plate or packaging. Here is a sample of what they mean:

| Marking | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `E1 R90` | Compliant with ECE R90 standard, approved in Germany. |
| `FMVSS 135` | Meets the US safety standard for braking systems. |
| `IATF 16949` | Manufactured in a facility certified to this quality standard. |

## Technical Data Overview
This section outlines the typical performance characteristics of different brake pad materials, which are tested against the above standards.

| Material Type | Friction Coefficient (μ) | Noise Level | Dust Output | Rotor Wear |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ceramic** | Stable, Medium-High | Very Low | Very Low | Low |
| **Low-Metallic (NAO)** | Medium | Low | Medium | Very Low |
| **Semi-Metallic** | High | Medium-High | High | Medium-High |

*Note: This is a generalized overview. Specific formulations vary by manufacturer.*
